^3

I need to find the indefinite integral of this function.

To find the indefinite integral of a function, we need to find an antiderivative of that function. An antiderivative is a function whose derivative equals the original function. In this case, we want to find an antiderivative for f(x) = x^3.

To find the antiderivative, we will use the power rule for differentiation, which states that if you have a function of the form g(x) = (ax)^n, then the derivative is n*a*(x)^(n-1). In this case, the function f(x) = x^3 has a form of (1x)^3, so using the power rule, we know that the derivative of f(x) = x^3 is 3*(1x)^(2), which is 3*x^2.

Now, to find an antiderivative, we will use the fact that the derivative of our antidervative should be equal to f(x) = x^3. Thus, our antiderivative will have the form:
