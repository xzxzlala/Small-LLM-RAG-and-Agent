Building, Atherton House, and YMCA Hotel are historic buildings among dozens of historical landmarks in the city, according to the National Register of Historic Places listings in San Francisco.[109]\\nGeography[edit]\\nSan Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States, at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay within its boundaries. Over 44% of adults have a bachelor\'s or higher degree.[172]\\nSan Francisco had the highest rate at 7,031 per square mile, or over 344,000 total graduates in the city\'s 46.7 square miles (121\\u00a0km2).[173]\\nSan Francisco has the highest estimated percentage of gay and lesbian individuals of any of the 50 largest U.S. cities, at 15%.[174]\\nSan Francisco also has the highest percentage of same-sex households of any American county, with the Bay Area having a higher concentration than any other metropolitan area.[175]\\nSan Francisco ranks third of American cities in median household income[176] with a 2007 value of $65,519.[159] Median family income is $81,136.[159]\\nAn emigration of middle-class families has left the city with a lower proportion of children than any other large American city,[177] with the dog population cited as exceeding the child population of 115,000, in 2018.[178]\\n The 2017 Global Financial Centres Index ranked San Francisco as the sixth-most competitive financial center in the world.[214]\\nBeginning in the 1990s, San Francisco\'s economy diversified away from finance and tourism towards the growing fields of high tech, biotechnology, and medical research.[215] Technology jobs accounted for just 1 percent of San Francisco\'s economy in 1990, growing to 4 percent in 2010 and an estimated 8 percent by the end of 2013.[216] San Francisco became a center of Internet start-up companies during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the subsequent social media boom of the late 2000s (decade).[217] Since 2010, San Francisco proper has attracted an increasing share of venture capital investments as compared to nearby Silicon Valley, attracting 423 financings worth US$4.58\\u00a0billion in 2013.[218][219][220] The city is home to a number of educational and cultural institutions, such as the University of California, San Francisco, the University of San Francisco, San Francisco State University, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, the de Young Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Ballet, the San Francisco Opera, the SFJAZZ Center, and the California Academy of Sciences. The United Nations Charter creating the United Nations was drafted and signed in San Francisco in 1945 and, in 1951, the Treaty of San Francisco re-established peaceful relations between Japan and the Allied Powers.[89]\\nUrban planning projects in the 1950s and 1960s involved widespread destruction and redevelopment of west-side neighborhoods and the construction of new freeways, of which only a series of short segments were built before being halted by citizen-led opposition.[90] The onset of containerization made San Francisco\'s small piers obsolete, and cargo activity moved to the larger Port of Oakland.[91]"}]', name='tavily_search_results_json', tool_call_id='call_c1dv')]}}
