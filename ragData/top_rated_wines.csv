Agharta Black Label Red 2004,"North Coast, California",Red Wine,98.0,"Evolved aromas of roasted earth, dried leather and meat jus immediately emerge from the surface of this opaque liquid. Eventually fruit aromas respond to your coaxing and tiny currants, the ripest blackberries and the densest of blue fruits fill out the darker more evolved aromas of leather and tar. The wine is thick and immediately mouth coating with a very richly textured and immensely concentrated sensation of fruit and spice. The secondary aromas of delicate white flowers, black summer truffles and dark roasted coffee highlight the fruit as the wine unfolds in your mouth. This wine isn’t noticeably oaky or excruciatingly tannic or seemingly sweet, it is just all kind of 'there' composed and finely knit together in a very decadent glass of wine. "
